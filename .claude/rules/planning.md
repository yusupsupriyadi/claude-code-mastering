# Planning Rules

## Task Planning Requirement

- **ALWAYS** before developing something, create a task plan in `plans/` directory
- Create folders for each task and create documents in that folder

## MCP Tools Usage

Refer to CLAUDE.md for full MCP usage rules (Sequential Thinking, Serena, Context7-MCP).

## Error Handling and Debugging

When issues arise:

1. Check Docker container logs first
2. Verify that all required services are running
3. Ensure environment variables and configurations are correct
4. Follow existing error handling patterns when implementing fixes
5. Test changes in the development environment before proposing production changes
