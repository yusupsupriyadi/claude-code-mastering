# Code Style Rules

## Code Structure and Consistency

- Always examine the overall codebase structure before making any changes
- Follow existing code patterns, naming conventions, and architectural decisions unless explicitly instructed otherwise
- Maintain consistency with the existing codebase style:
  - File organization and directory structure
  - Import statements ordering and grouping
  - Variable and function naming conventions
  - Code formatting and indentation
  - Comment and documentation styles

## Code Quality

- Follow the established error handling patterns
- Maintain existing logging practices and levels
- Ensure proper type annotations where used
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic only
- Follow the existing import organization
- **Write every comment in English**

## Before Making Changes

1. Examine the existing codebase structure and patterns
2. Understand the current implementation approach
3. Identify any existing similar functionality to maintain consistency
4. Check for existing tests and ensure new code follows the same testing patterns

## File Editing

- When you edit files, do not create backup files - edit directly
- Do not create unnecessary documentation files unless requested
