Start Storybook development server for component preview.

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will start Storybook at http://localhost:6006

## Tips:
- Use Storybook for isolated component development
- Create stories for new components in `*.stories.tsx` files
- Test different props and states visually
- Document component usage with story descriptions
